# Wongdle: the greedy wordle

Wongdle is a version of wordle where the computer tries to cheat its human opponent by delaying as much as possible.



## Origin of code   

Initial wordle code was taken from pixiegamie's tutorial on how to code wordle in python: https://github.com/pixegami/python-wordle

Using that code as my base, I built my own implementation of the greedy wordle.
